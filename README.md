### Clone GitHub repository

Use your system's Terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

    cd user/themes 
    git clone https://github.com/cron-ix/grav-theme-sampple.git sampple/

This will install the Sampple theme into your `user/themes/sampple` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/themes/sampple`.

### Download zip file

To install this theme, just download the zip version of this repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/cron-ix/grav-theme-sampple) and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/themes`. Then, rename the folder to `sampple`.
